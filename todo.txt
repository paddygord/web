interactive python script for setting up DNS/IP/firewall configuration
    howto buy domain name and configure
    ask for domain name used and ddns password
    input that to swag and ddclient config
    instructions for router/firewall setup
    and test for connectivity/correctness at each step

ip address connectivity
dont want to pay for static ip, use ddclient
first make sure it works on just ipv6
ipv6 only supported on docker on linux
ipv6 doesn't seem to work on smarty data connection
ipv6 partially works on wifi on firefox android, firefox avoids using ipv6 for some reason

then make sure it works on just ipv4
